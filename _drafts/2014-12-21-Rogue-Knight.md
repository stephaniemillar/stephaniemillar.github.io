Brandon Mull is one of my absolute favorite authors and I was beyond excited to get this newest book of his that was released mid-November. [Rogue Knight](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1442497033/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1442497033&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=LRRRHCHPBOKODUUZ) is the second book of Mull's newest series called *The Five Kingdoms*. The book (and series) follow Cole, a boy from our world, and all the challenges he encounters after finding himself stuck in another world called The Outskirts, in which there are five kingdoms, each with their own form of magic. Each book in the series focuses on a different kingdom. 

*The Rogue Knight* is set in the kingdom of Elloweer, where Cole and his friends attempt to find one of Mira's lost sisters, Honor. The kingdom of Elloweer is facing to major threats when Cole arrives and their mission to find Honor brings them straight into the conflict. Firstly, there is a mysterious man called the Rogue Knight who is going from town to town overthrowing the government and throwing everything into chaos. The other threat is much more dangerous: an even more mysterious being named Morgassa destroying everything and everyone she comes in contact with.
