Anthony Doerr has intrigued me since I fell in love with his short stories after attending a reading he did at BYU a year or so ago. At the reading, he spoke about writing and what he said definitely inspired me in my own writing. He encouraged everyone to write about what they loved, which in his case was natural history and science. In everything he has written, including *All The Light We Cannot See*, Doerr brings the world of science to life, while not making it the focal point of his stories. **That** is what is so beautiful about his writing. His stories absolutely ooze his enthusiasm for the world of science and natural curiosity, making you, as the reader, feel that same wonder. 

*All The Light We Cannot See* has made it into my list of all-time favorite books, for sure. It is beautifully composed and perfectly executed. Because I am so in love with the book, and because I think such an important part of the story is finding things out as you go, I am going to avoid as many possible spoilers as possible, which means I will not be discussing details of the plot. I will, however, say that the ending was probably the best ending I have ever read. Doerr was not afraid to be bold and that faith in his own story brought one of the most heart-wrenchingly beautiful stories I have ever read into being. 

As a brief (and mostly spoiler-free) overview, the story follows two different people from two very different worlds. The book is set during World War II and shows the war through diverse lenses. Marie-Laure LeBlanc is a young French girl, who has lost her sight. She is a very curious girl who devours whatever books her father can afford to give to her. Werner Pfenig is a German boy who is obsessed with radios and technology and how they work. The book shows both of their stories as Marie-Laure is trapped in France after the German takeover and Werner is forced to be a part of the German forces. We see the ugliness and brutality of war, but also the beauty and goodness of others in the face of darkness. And all of this is expressed in language so perfectly crafted that you forget that you're reading a book as you fall so easily into the world Doerr has created.  

*All The Light We Cannot See* is a masterpiece. Nothing I have to say about this book can truly do it justice. Just read it. Then you will understand.
