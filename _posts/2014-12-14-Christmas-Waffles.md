This is a recipe for Gingerbread Waffles with Vanilla–Orange Butter, which my husband and I have dubbed "Christmas Waffles" because that's exactly what they taste like: **Christmas**. I stumbled upon this recipe [here](http://www.chow.com/recipes/30529-gingerbread-waffles-with-vanilla-bean-and-orange-butter) while searching for something to make with some leftover buttermilk that I had and I am glad I did! It is delicious!

I was initially hesitant to try this recipe because the few comments on the page didn't have great experiences with it, but I decided to try it anyways because my husband was enamored with them. They take a bit more time than regular waffles, but they are wonderful and so worth it. 

I thought it was strange to bake the waffles after cooking them in the waffle iron, but it's actually a **really** important step. When the waffles come out of the waffle iron, they are super flimsy and soft. While I'm a fan of soft, chewy waffles, they were a little too soft. Baking them in the oven for a few minutes gives them the perfect firmness. 

We do not own a Belgian waffle iron, so we used our regular waffle iron, which means we made **way** more than the estimated 8 waffles  the website says it will make (about 18), but we were okay with that. 

The waffles were delcious and the gingerbread flavor made them taste gourmet. The vanilla-orange butter and maple syrup are **musts** for this recipe. The orange flavor and sugary syrup perfectly complement the bitter flavor of the gingerbread and make it a **perfect** Christmas breakfast.

Instructions
-----
**Vanilla-Orange Butter:**  

1. Place the butter in a medium bowl and mash it with a rubber spatula until it’s very spreadable. 
2. Add the vanilla extract, zest, and salt and mix until thoroughly combined; set aside.

**Waffles:**

1. Heat the oven to 250°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and place it in the oven.
2. Whisk together the flour, sugar, ginger, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, allspice, and cloves in a large bowl to aerate and break up any lumps; set aside.
3. Place the eggs in a large bowl and whisk until they’re just broken up. Add the buttermilk, melted butter, molasses, and vanilla and whisk until evenly combined.
4. Add the buttermilk mixture to the reserved flour mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until the flour is just incorporated and no streaks remain. (The batter may have a few lumps.)
5. Heat up waffle iron. Once heated, fill it with batter, close the lid, and cook until the steam starts to diminish (open the top and peek for doneness after a few minutes). Transfer the waffle to the wire rack on the baking sheet in the oven and bake for a couple minutes, until more firm. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve immediately with the vanilla-orange butter and maple syrup, if using.
