For those of you who don't know what Swig sugar cookies are, they are **the** best sugar cookies you will ever have. Swig cookies are made by a small business of the same name located in Provo and St. George, Utah. [Swig](http://www.swigstop.com/) is best known for its cookies, which are **fantastic** and definitely worth making. I found this recipe for Swig knock-off cookies [here](http://www.vintagerevivals.com/2013/03/swig-sugar-cookie-recipe-literally-best.html). 

The cookies were super easy to make and taste **just like** Swig cookies. I was pretty surprised. Most knock-off recipes don't turn out as good as the real thing, but this was not one of them. My husband and I absolutely love them.

Just as a word of caution, this recipe makes **a lot** of cookies. Like, a lot. The couple times that I've made this recipe, we've had to give away plates of cookies to multiple friends and neighbors so that we wouldn't gorge ourselves on mountains of cookies. If you don't want a lot of cookies, you should probably half (or even quarter) the recipe. 

While the recipe for the actual cookies comes from the website above, the frosting does not. I did not have sour cream the first time I made this (and I don't particularly like sour cream frosting to begin with) so I used my own frosting recipe, which I have included below. I really liked this frosting recipe with the cookies and it still tasted **just** like Swig cookies.




Ingredients
-----------
 **Sugar Cookies:**  
<input type="checkbox"> 1 cup butter   
<input type="checkbox"> 3/4 cup vegetable oil  
<input type="checkbox"> 1 1/4 cup sugar  
<input type="checkbox"> 3/4 cup powdered sugar  
<input type="checkbox"> 2 tbsp water  
<input type="checkbox"> 2 eggs  
<input type="checkbox"> 1 tsp baking powder  
<input type="checkbox"> 1 tsp salt  
<input type="checkbox"> 5 1/2 cup flour  
  
**Frosting:**  
<input type="checkbox"> 4 cups powdered sugar    
<input type="checkbox"> 1/2 cup shortening   
<input type="checkbox"> 5 tablespoons milk    
<input type="checkbox"> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions
-----
**Sugar Cookies:**  

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Cream together butter, vegetable oil, sugars, water, and eggs.
3. Combine dry ingredients and slowly add to butter mixture. Mix until everything is combined.
4. Roll a golf ball sized ball of dough and place it on your cookie sheet.
5. Put 1/4 c of sugar and a pinch of salt on a plate. Stick the bottom of a glass in it.  
6. Firmly press the glass into the center of your dough ball. You want your dough to spill out over the sides of the glass.  
7. Bake for 8 minutes. They should just barely be browning on the bottom. Move cookies to a cooling rack.  

**Frosting:**

1. In a large bowl, cream together the powdered sugar and shortening until smooth. 
2. Gradually mix in the milk and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth and stiff, about 5 minutes. 
3. Color with food coloring if desired.
