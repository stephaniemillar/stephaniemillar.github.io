While Mortals Sleep is a fantastic collection of previously unpublished short stories written by Kurt Vonnegut. I was first introduced to Vonnegut this last semester in my short story class and fell in love with his writing. His writing is beautiful, real, and meaningful. This specific collection of short stories was recommended to me by a service that the Penguin company was doing for the holidays called the [Penguin Hotline](http://www.penguin.com/penguinhotline/) where they would recommend books to read based on personal interests and preferences. I actually found quite a few books that I really enjoyed through their service, this being one them. 

Vonnegut is a very interesting author. Unlike many modern authors, Vonnegut chooses to write about morality and reveals definitive opinions of what is right and wrong. Most, if not all, of the stories in this collection show the difference between the good and the bad and teach us to be better, kinder people. **That** is why I love Vonnegut's writing so much. He is unafraid to pronounce his beliefs and has a purpose for his writing beyond just telling a story. His stories are about **improvement** and personal betterment. 

I **thoroughly** enjoyed reading this collection of stories and I think anyone who enjoys short stories would feel the same. The stories are very real and believable. It feels like it is something that could actually happen in real life. And the fact that the characters become better people through the lessons they learn in the story makes you feel like a better person after reading it. It opens our eyes to the flaws that affect us all and helps us be more patient with other's flaws and less permissive with our own.
