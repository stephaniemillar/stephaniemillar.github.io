I have been a **serious** Brandon Mull fan since I fell in love with the world of *Fablehaven* almost ten years ago and I've enjoyed every one of his books since then. *Crystal Keepers* is his most recent release and is the third book of his latest series *The Five Kingdoms*. This series has a very similar feel to, and occassionally references, Mull's previous series *The Beyonders*. 

The story follows an all too familiar pattern: kids from our world end up in an entirely new world with no way to return home and have to face the harsh realities of being strangers in a new, strange, and corrupt world. However, this series differs from other Brandon Mull books by involving more than just two main characters from our world. While the story centers on Cole Randolph and his quest to save The Five Kingdoms from a nefarious ruler, it also shows how Cole's friends have dealt with their fate. Because of that we see different perspectives and different ways of dealing with the shock of being forcefully injected into a new world and culture. 

While the main characters in all of Mull's books are usually children, his books weave a much deeper narrative that speaks to people of all ages. What I find interesting about this series is how the different kids react so differently to being sent to a new world. Some simply accept their fate, however unwillingly, and do nothing to try to escape or improve their situation. Others, like Cole's friend Dalton, see value in trying to escape their lives as slaves, but only for the end goal of returning home to a much easier life. 

Cole differs from everyone in that regard. He has the most altruistic outlook on his situation. He sees how he is valuable to the world he has been plopped into and as a result he is willing to stay in the world as long as necessary to help where he can. He is the only one who accepts the challenges that have been placed in his way. He obviously misses his family and his old life, but instead of despairing he rises to the challenge and actively fights for his goals. He joins the rebellion to help his friends and because he believes it is the right thing to do. And he refuses to give up on finding a way back to his home, despite how impossible everyone tells him it is. And **that** is something that speaks to all of us. We won't get anywhere in life if we hide behind doubts and don't use the skills and tools we have been given to make a way for ourselves. Nor will we get very far if we don't have the perseverence to pursue our passions and help each other. *Crystal Keepers* teaches that pretty well.

The book also introduces a world that Brandon Mull had not yet delved into. Most of his books involve a lot of fantasy, but this book dealt with some serious science-fiction. Zeropolis, the third kingdom, is run purely by technology-based magic. As a result, Mull introduces a lot of really cool tech into this new world (bullet trains, autonomous super-computers, and some *Ender's Game* reminiscent suits). The new world that Mull created in *Crystal Keepers* makes me beyond excited for the next kingdom to be introduced. I'll just have to be patient for the next year to find out.
