![Blood of Olympus](http://www.whynotarhino.com/images/posts/blood-of-olympus/header.png)

I finished [Blood of Olympus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423146735/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1423146735&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=EMXKNKXY2EUJXOIY) this past week. I always have mixed feelings about finishing a series. I end up investing so much into the characters that by the end of it, I feel like I'm saying goodbye to close friends. This series was fantastic, though, and I'm glad Rick Riordan decided to continue on with the Percy Jackson story line because he is a genius.

This book is **fantastic**! As always, I really enjoyed the mythology that Riordan incorporated into the story. He does such a good job of combining the ancient with the modern. I was also impressed by Riordan's choice to explore some of the more seemingly minor characters for the final book of the series. I was expecting to have chapters at least from Annabeth and Percy, but instead, we got perspectives from two characters we have yet to see: Nico and Reyna. I think that is what made this book compelling. The action wasn't overly exciting or impressive, but what pushed me to keep reading was the internal struggles these characters faced. Finally being able to see into their minds made them much more real. It was nice to see **why** they acted the way that they did. 

[Reyna](http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Reyna_Avila_Ram%C3%ADrez-Arellano) had been one of my least favorite characters up until this book. In all the other books she had seemed too much like the "perfect Roman soldier." It didn't really seem like she had much emotion. But this book revealed **so much** about her personality. She went from being a stoic leader to a courageous and compassionate friend. One of my favorite things about her in this book was how willing she was to lend her strength to those in need, no matter the toll it took on her. I enjoyed being able to see her reasons behind being so selfless. 

Seeing [Nico's](http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Nico_di_Angelo) character development throughout the story was interesting as well. Until this book, we had yet to really see what Nico was struggling with. He just seemed like a moody loner. But being able to see all the weight he had been carrying with him and his determination to help his friends made his pain seem so much more **real**. I actually sympathized with Nico and his struggles. He became one of the most relateable characters for me, as I'm sure he did for many others as well. 

One theme that always seems prevalent in Rick Riordan books is that of friendship, and I think it is one of the strongest messages in [Blood of Olympus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423146735/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1423146735&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=EMXKNKXY2EUJXOIY). The length that his characters will go to to help their friends is incredible and inspiring. Throughout all the trials that these friends faced, they never once gave up or turned on each other. They were with each other until the very end and never doubted their trust. **That** is the truest quality of a hero.
