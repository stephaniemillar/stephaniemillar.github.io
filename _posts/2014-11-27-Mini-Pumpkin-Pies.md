These are one of the desserts I made for Thanksgiving this year. They were my first attempt at pies and they turned out wonderfully! This recipe is pretty simple and easy to make. The recipe is from [makeandtakes.com](http://www.makeandtakes.com/muffin-tin-pumpkin-pies), the recipe for the filling comes from the [can of pumpkin](https://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18470/libbys-famous-pumpkin-pie/), and the whipped cream recipe is courtesy of [Alton Brown](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/whipped-cream-recipe.html).

The pies are delicious and they're perfect because you don't even have to cut them to serve them, making them great for large gatherings. They look pretty fancy, too, which is always a plus.

**Pie Filling:**

1. Mix sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves in small bowl. 
2. Beat eggs in large bowl. 
3. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. 
4. Gradually stir in evaporated milk.
5. Pour into pie shells.

**Pie Crust:**

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Unroll your dough. Using a bowl or 4 inch round cookie cutter, cut out 12 circles from your 2 9-inch pie crust doughs. (You will be able to cut out 4 from the roll, then you can knead it again and roll it with a rolling pin to cut more).
3. Place each circle into a pre-greased muffin tin. Press them in, letting the sides come up for a fun look. 
4. Pour your filling into each muffin tin cup. Fill them to the very top.
5. Bake your muffin tin pumpkin pies at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Then turn your heat down to 350 degrees and bake them for 25-30 minutes. 
6. Let these cool on a wire rack for a couple of hours to let the pumpkin filling set.
7. Add a dollop of whipped cream to each individual muffin tin pie.


**Whipped Cream:**

1. Place a metal mixing bowl and metal whisk into the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.  
2. Place the sugar into the mixing bowl and add the whipping cream. Whisk just until the cream reaches stiff peaks.   
3. Store any unused portion in an airtight container for up to 10 hours. When ready to use, rewhisk for 10 to 15 seconds.
