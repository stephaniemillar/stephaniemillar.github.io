This is a recipe I tried from the [Cooking Classy](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2014/09/neapolitan-cupcakes/) website, which I found on Pinterest. I was initially hesitant to try it because of the somewhat unconventional cupcake recipe, but it turned out wonderfully. Cupcakes that taste like ice cream? I'm always down.  

 I followed a majority of the recipe precisely, but I made a few minior subsitutions. (The recipe I posted reflects my substitutions. You can see the original recipe if you click on the Cooking Classy link above). I substituted vanilla extract for the vanilla bean seeds. I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't just have those lying around. And from what I read online about vanilla bean seeds, they aren't an essential part of a recipe. A very select group of super tasters can actually taste the difference between using vanilla bean and vanilla extract.  
 
 I also substituted all-purpose flour and cornstarch for the cake flour. I learned [here](http://joythebaker.com/2013/12/baking-101-the-best-cake-flour-substitute/) that for every cup of flour, if you take away two tablespoons of the flour and replace it with cornstarch, it will work just as well as cake flour.  
 
The cupcakes do take some time to make, so don't expect to have them done quickly. The recipe was fairly easy to follow, though. And the cupcakes taste **just like neopolitan ice cream.** Seriously. They are delicious and definitely worth the effort.

4. Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to butter/sugar mixture and mix until combined.   
5. Add 1/2 of the milk/egg mixture and mix on low speed until combined then increase to medium speed and mix 1 minute.

2. Pour reduced puree into a small bowl, then freeze until cool, stirring occasionally.  
3. With a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to whip unsalted and salted butter until very pale and fluffy.  
4. Mix in 1 cup powdered sugar, then blend in 3 Tbsp reduced strawberry puree, and vanilla extract.  
5. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and continue to mix until frosting is pale and fluffy. You can add in an additional powdered sugar if needed to reach desired consistency.
