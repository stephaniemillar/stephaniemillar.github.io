I am a **huge** fan of Rick Riordan and all of his books, but when I saw "Percy Jackson's Greek Gods" at a bookstore, I wasn't entirely sure whether I wanted to read it or not. It is not like any of his other books. It isn't really narrative fiction, though the writing style creates that sort of tone. Rather, it's Riordan's own retelling of Greek myths through the eyes of his most beloved character, Percy Jackson. While I was unsure at first, I'm glad that I took the time to read it. **It did not disappoint.** 

Everytime I read Riordan, I am absolutely amazed at his ability to get inside the head of a teenager. It **really** feels like it's just a kid telling you the stories that he knows about the Greek gods. The book is charming and hilarious in a cheesy way. I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book when I definitely wasn't expecting to. It seems that Riordan never takes himself seriously in his writing and you can tell that he probably had as much fun writing his books as his readers have reading them. And **that** is what makes his books. 

I have read a **lot** of mythology books in my lifetime, both as a nerdy little girl obsessed with all things mythology and as a college student fascinated with the elements of mythology that pervade today's society. While I love reading about mythology, there is a definitely a large number of mythology textbooks that feel like they're made to put you to sleep. "Percy Jackson's Greek God's" is not one of those books. Where the story is deficient in detail and fact at times (and Riordan acknowledges that), it makes up for in pure entertainment and readability. 

One of my first thoughts after reading the book was how great it would be to introduce my future children into the world of mythology with this book. Riordan has done a beautiful job of melding the beliefs and stories of the ancient world with elements of the modern world and you can see that in all of his books, but especially in this one. 

"Percy Jackson's Greek Gods" is a book for all ages to acquaint and reacquaint themselves with Greek mythology through the **beautiful** prose of Riordan and the **absolutely gorgeous** illustrations that breathe new life into stories that have been around for centuries.
