![Holiday Frozen Hot Chocolate](http://stephaniemillar.github.io/images/posts/holiday-frozen-hot-chocolate/header.png)

This is **THE BEST** frozen hot chocolate I have ever tried (and I've tried quite a few). It is **super** easy and **super** delicious! My husband and I literally have it almost every single night. I found this recipe [here](http://www.laurenslatest.com/halloween-oreo-frozen-hot-chocolate-kitchenaid-giveaway/) and then substituted Christmas oreos for Halloween oreos. You can really make this with any kind of oreos though. 

Ingredients
-----------
<input type="checkbox"> 1 1/2 cups cold milk  
<input type="checkbox"> 1 cup crushed ice or 2 cups ice cubes  
<input type="checkbox"> 2 Tbsp hot chocolate mix  
<input type="checkbox"> 1/2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder   
<input type="checkbox"> 1/2 Tbsp sugar   
<input type="checkbox"> 5 Christmas Oreo cookies, broken into pieces   
<input type="checkbox"> Spray whipped cream        
 



Instructions
-----

1. In a blender, pour in milk, ice, hot chocolate mix, cocoa powder, sugar and oreos. 
2. Blend until desired consistency is reached and no ice remains. 
3. Pour into glasses and top with whipped cream. 
4. Serve immediately.
