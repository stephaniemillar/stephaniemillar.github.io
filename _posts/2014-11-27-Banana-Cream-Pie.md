This is another pie that I attempted for Thanksgiving (I failed to get a picture of it before it was already partly devoured). This was my first attempt at an entirely homemade pie. I found the recipe for old fashioned banana cream pie [here](http://www.food.com/recipe/old-fashioned-banana-cream-pie-14979) and decided it would be fun to make the pie from scratch instead of using banana pudding and cool whip. It definitely takes a bit more time to make, **but the time is worth it!** Everyone loved my pie and it was the first one to disappear.

I decided to take the advice of the pie recipe and make a meringue to top it off with. I found a good meringue recipe [here](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/good-meringue/). It was fairly easy to make since the recipe is so simple, though it did take a while for it to actually get fluffy, even with the mixer on high speed. The meringue turned out great though and it definitely added to the flavor of the pie. I really enjoyed the process of making this pie and it turned out much better than I had expected. I'm grateful for that, and that I was able to share it with those I love.
