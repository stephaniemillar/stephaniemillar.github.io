I have been meaning to read Rick Riordan's [The House of Hades](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423146727/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1423146727&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=MO4QZDJZZMZXIGJH) since it came out last year. This week, I **finally** got around to it reading it in order to gear up for the release of [The Blood of Olympus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423146735/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1423146735&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=ZO4TP5WQGBKZRYFG) on October 7th. Holy Narnia, I'm excited for that book to hit my doorstep after reading House of Hades.

I'm always happily surprised by Riordan's writing ability. I **love** how he can write as well as he can in the mindset of a bunch of teenagers, while still delving through deeper literary themes. His new method of dedicating entire chapters to the perspective of a single character in [The Heroes of Olympus series](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1484720725/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1484720725&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=TV3JTRIFPLQQ66QE) allows for much greater character development. The characters become more round, despite the fact that they're terribly flawed teenagers still **becoming** themselves.

The book began rapidly, jumping straight into the action with a million things going on at once in a short amount of time (which makes sense after the super chaotic ending of [Mark of Athena](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423142004/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1423142004&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=7LLM6YAGUIU3SSZF)). Once things started to slow down, as much as they can slow down in a Riodan book, I began to enjoy it much more. Ironically, there were quite a few **human** moments that actually touched me. 

One of the most touching characters in the book was Bob the Janitor (aka brainwashed [Iapetus](http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Iapetus)). The character development of Bob explored the idea of change. Bob, who is a Titan, is a being that has pretty much been around since the beginning of the mythological world. He is a child of Gaea who was, along with Tartarus, one of the first beings to exist. Bob has been the same person for a long, **long** time. Because of that, it is assumed that immortal beings don't change, which is obviously a false assumption because we've seen the gods reluctantly change over time throughout both series.

However, we've never seen a titan change. The interesting thing about these characters is that they are **always** seen as the villains, because, for the most part, they are. The titans were eventually overthrown as the earth's rulers because they were terrible at it. They cared more about destruction than anything else, supposedly because it was their nature. The question Riordan wrestles with in this book is whether nature determines character.

Iapetus was evil just like every other Titan before his memory was washed away by the [River Lethe](http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/River_Lethe). After that, he was given a new identity, Bob, by Percy, and was assigned the role of a janitor for Hades. Once again, Bob didn't choose for himself who he was. He just accepted what he was told. 

Bob's struggle in the story is choosing who he really is. While traveling through Tartarus with Percy and Annabeth, Bob starts to piece together his past and realize who he was before he became Bob. After talking with one of Bob's Titan brothers, Percy asks Bob how he feels after being reminded of his past. His response is almost poetic:

> "When he told it, I remembered. He handed me my past like...like a spear. But I do not know if I should take it. Is it still mine, if I do not want it?"

The amazing thing is, even after remembering who he was, he chooses who he will be from then on. He doesn't go back to who he was "destined to be," nor does he entirely remain stationary as his new self. He realizes that he can be who he wants to be, that his nature determines nothing. In the fight against Tartarus, Bob defiantly proclaims:

> "I choose to be more than Iapetus...You do not control me. I am not like my brothers."

Bob teaches all of us that we're in charge of who we are and who we become. Circumstance, fate, and experience isn't what matters. Our choices are what we are made of and Riordan did a beautiful job of expressing that. While the entirety of  [House of Hades](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423146727/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1423146727&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=JV7GBAN2PLIN3LRY) was great, the story of Bob the Janitor is what spoke to my soul. 

So, here's to Bob.
