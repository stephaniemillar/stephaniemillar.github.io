The minute I read the synopsis for *The Grimm Legacy*, I knew it was my kind of book. I had never read anything by Polly Shulman, nor had I even heard of her, but man, am I glad I stumbled upon this book. It combines my (at times, unhealthy) obsession with books, libraries, secrets and fairytales with a simple, yet fantastic story that was thoroughly entertaining.  

The book revolves around a secret library full of magical items from classic fairytales and stories. Elizabeth, the protagonist, becomes employed as a page at the New York Circulating Material Repository, a library that circulates objects rather than books, and as she becomes introduced into the beautiful and magical world that is a library, she eventually discovers a secret collection, known as the Grimm Collection, where artifacts from fairytales are kept (items like the magic mirror from Snow White, or Cinderella's slipper). 

Not only does the book involve basically everything I love, but it is an excellent mystery. Shortly after getting the job, Elizabeth discovers that magical objects at the repository have been going missing and no one knows who could be taking them. Elizabeth and her fellow pages work together to figure out who that someone is (using quite a few familiar magical items along the way). 

While the story is not incredibly deep, it is pure entertainment. Shulman does a wonderful job bringing familiar fairytales to life through the objects associated with them. The simplicity of her writing style makes the story easy to take in (or devour, in my case) and helps you sink into the beauty of her world. I definitely think that it should be much more popular than it is. So, for any book lovers out there, read *The Grimm Legacy*. You'll like it. Promise.
