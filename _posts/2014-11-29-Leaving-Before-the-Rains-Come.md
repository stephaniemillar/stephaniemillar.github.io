I got early access to [Leaving Before the Rains Come](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594205868/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594205868&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=MC2QHQOEN2O7ZFAQ) from the Penguin [First to Read](http://www.firsttoread.com/) program. Every month Penguin allows users to enter for a chance to read an advance galley of one of several books that will be coming out in the next couple months. First to Read is great! If you like books and haven't already signed up, you definitely should. I can attest that it is **definitely** worth it! 

[Leaving Before the Rains Come](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594205868/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594205868&linkCode=as2&tag=stephmilla-20&linkId=MC2QHQOEN2O7ZFAQ) will be officially released on January 22, 2015. Since this book hasn't been released yet, I'll try my best to avoid any spoilers.  

I've always been a fiction reader, so I was a little wary when I first started this memoir. I had also never heard of Alexandra Fuller, but I'm **so glad** this is the book that introduced me to her writing. Fuller is in all senses a master of words. She has a crazy ability to express her experiences in such a way that not only makes it enjoyable but also teaches deeper lessons that connect with your soul.

Fuller's story is **ridiculously** compelling and charming. I found myself hungering to read more whenever I wasn't able to read. She does a wonderful job giving life to all the characters in her life. The way she describes her parents and sister make them out to be both eccentric and endearing. I smiled every time they were brought up in the stories from her past. 

Much of the memoir hinges on Fuller's struggle to figure out her identity. Her life is made up of several conflicting identities: she grew up in South Africa, had a British father and extended family and eventually ended up in the United States after marrying an American man. She spends a majority of her life trying to reconcile all these different identities and figure out what it means to have an individual identity. I think this is what drives the entire memoir. 
 
 
>“What I didn’t know then was that ignoring my own southern African knowledge was its own kind of mischief: it rendered me speechless when I should have spoken, helpless when I was profoundly capable, and broken when in fact the very places inside me that had been damaged and snapped were their own kind of strength.”


Over time she realizes that she has to stop compromising her identity and be who she really is. After spending her entire life hoping someone will come along and save her, she is finally able to save herself by accepting who she really is and where she comes from.

From Fuller's life story, we learn what it means to be yourself and what the cost is when you try to bury yourself in the identities of others around you.
