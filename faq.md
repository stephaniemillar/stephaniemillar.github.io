**Why do you read?**

Books have been my world since I learned how to read. I remember as a child going to the public library every single week and checking out the maximum amount of books (50) every single time. I would get home and go through book after book after book, soaking in every word, never wanting it to end. Books were and are my life. There have been times in my life where I haven’t had any friends to turn to, but books have always been there. They open our minds and allow us to be someone else. To feel what someone else feels, see what someone else sees. I love how we can learn things and gain experience from books while never leaving the safety of the real world. We can know what it’s like to travel to another world, or to sword fight, or to captain a ship without actually doing it. More importantly, we can feel things in books. We can gain sympathy towards others as we learn to understand the world from different perspectives and empathize with characters who deal with the same struggles that we do. Books give us the best and worst of our world and make us confront it all, which is why we all love books so much. We make books, and books make us.

**Why should I care what you have to say about baking?**

I will admit right away that I have no formal training in baking. Everything I’ve learned about baking has come through experience: both successes and failures. I have no qualifications whatsoever to be an authority over baking. BUT, I do have a passion for it. Originally, I loved baking because I could make delicious sugary things that I then immediately devoured. Overtime, my passion has grown from wanting to make make delicious things that I can eat to merely wanting to make delicious things. I think a recipe review blog would be helpful because there are so many recipes floating around on the internet now. Pinterest is a mess of recipes from everywhere, and pinners have no idea if the recipes are any good or not. I’ve found a number of good recipes online, but I’ve also found quite a few bad ones. Most blogs don’t rate their own recipes so there’s no way to know what other peoples’ experience with the recipe is. My goal with my recipe reviews is to be honest about the recipes I try and give helpful suggestions for ways that recipes could be improved. I will always give credit to the original blog and don’t in any way intend to steal recipes from others and make them my own (as I’ve seen many other blogs do lately).
