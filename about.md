I'm just a girl who loves books and food. I dream bigger than I probably should. I love words and I love making something out of nothing.  I have a wonderful [husband](jessemillar.com), whom I also love, who helps me run this blog and encourages me to share my ideas. That's what this blog is for. To share what I love.
